# Rename Images

Moves pictures while renaming in bulk.  This script by default recursively dives into a directory 
and copies all jpg files to the ${HOME}/Pictures folder.  Each file is parsed to try to find the 
date the picture was taken, and is named with the date it was taken, and placed in a sub-folder 
for the year it was taken.
